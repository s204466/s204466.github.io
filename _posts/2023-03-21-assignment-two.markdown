Just Visualizing data is one thing, but also discovering why The data looks as it does is just as important as the data itself. In the following we are goind to explore the evolution of Vehicle Theft in San Francisco between 2003 and 2017. To do this we are goind to be using the "Police_Department_Incident_Reports__Historical_2003_to_May_2018.csv" dataset where we take the information from the "VEHICLE THEFT" category. In this paper we will visualize how vehicle thefts has changed over time, and what areas of the San Francisco area have seen the most vehicle thefts. We will also explore reasons why the evolution of thefts looks as it does.
